# Blockchain Specialization

Completing Coursera's [Blockchain Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/blockchain). (repurposing this repo since gam api project is no longer relevant at work)

Mixing specialization material with other resources such as [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/)'s documentation and maybe later on other tutorials.

```
brew update
brew upgrade
brew tap ethereum/ethereum
brew install solidity
```
